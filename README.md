# Semantic Segmentation + Gaussian Processes for OCT Image Processing

This repository contains supplementary material for the paper "Deep Learning based Retinal OCT Segmentation".

## Data Set

### Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Images

For this work, we used the OCT data set curated by the authors of 

*  Tian, Jing, et al. "Performance evaluation of automated segmentation software on optical coherence tomography volume data." Journal of biophotonics 9.5 (2016): 478-489. 

The OCT data is publicly available as [supplementary material](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5025289/) of the aforementioned paper.


### Semantic Segmentation Model and Weights
